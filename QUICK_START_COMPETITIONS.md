   git add .
   git commit -m "✨ Add monthly competition feature with winner badges"
   git push origin develop
   ```

2. **Deploy to PythonAnywhere:**
   ```bash
   # SSH into PythonAnywhere
   cd ~/pushupCounter
   git pull origin develop
   pip install python-dateutil==2.9.0
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py create_competitions --months 3
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   # Click "Reload" on Web tab
   ```

3. **Set Winners via Admin:**
   - Visit `https://asavoiu.pythonanywhere.com/admin/`
   - Navigate to Competitions
   - Update past competitions with winners

### Automate Competition Creation (Optional)

Add to PythonAnywhere crontab to auto-create next month's competition:

```bash
# Run on 1st of each month at midnight
0 0 1 * * cd /home/asavoiu/pushupCounter && /home/asavoiu/.virtualenvs/pushupenv/bin/python manage.py create_competitions
```
