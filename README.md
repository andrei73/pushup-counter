## Advanced Configuration

### Changing the Secret Key (Production)
Edit `pushup_counter/settings.py`:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'your-new-secret-key-here'
```

### Using PostgreSQL (Production)
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'pushup_counter_db',
        'USER': 'your_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

### Allowed Hosts (Production)
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']
```

### Static Files (Production)
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't install crispy-bootstrap5
**Solution**: Make sure you have the correct version (2025.6)
```bash
pip install crispy-bootstrap5==2025.6
```

### Issue: Migration errors
**Solution**: Delete migrations and recreate
```bash
find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Issue: Date validation not working
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in and check if you're an admin

### Issue: Static files not loading
**Solution**: Run collectstatic or ensure DEBUG=True in development

## Development Tips

### Creating Test Data
Use the Django shell to create test entries:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from tracker.models import PushupEntry
from django.utils import timezone

user = User.objects.get(username='your_username')
PushupEntry.objects.create(user=user, date=timezone.now().date(), count=50)
```

### Running Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Database Shell
```bash
python manage.py dbshell
```
