# PWA Setup and Testing Guide

## 🎉 Congratulations! Your PWA is ready!

Your Pushup Counter is now a Progressive Web App! Here's how to deploy and test it.

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Generate Icons (Required!)

You need to create app icons before deploying. Choose one:

#### Option A: Quick Placeholder Icons
```bash
cd /Users/asavoiu/Workspace/Dev_Projects/fitCounter
pip install pillow
python generate_icons.py
```

This creates simple purple icons with 💪 emoji (good enough to start!).

#### Option B: Professional Icons
1. Design a 512x512 icon (use Canva, Figma, etc.)
2. Go to: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
3. Upload your design
4. Download all generated icons
5. Place in `static/icons/` directory

### 2. Collect Static Files

```bash
cd ~/pushupCounter
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

This copies all static files (including manifest and service worker) to the staticfiles directory.

---

## 🚀 Deployment to PythonAnywhere

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd /Users/asavoiu/Workspace/Dev_Projects/fitCounter
git add .
git commit -m "Add PWA support - manifest, service worker, icons"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Update on PythonAnywhere

In PythonAnywhere Bash console:

```bash
cd ~/pushupCounter
git pull origin main

# Generate placeholder icons if you haven't created custom ones
pip install pillow
python generate_icons.py

# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### Step 3: Reload Web App

Go to Web tab → Click "Reload"

## ✅ Testing Your PWA

### On Android (Chrome/Edge):

1. **Visit your site**: https://asavoiu.pythonanywhere.com
2. **Look for install prompt**: Should see banner at bottom OR green "Install App" button in navbar
3. **Click Install**: App icon appears on home screen
4. **Tap icon**: Opens full screen (no browser UI!)
5. **Test offline**: 
   - Open app
   - Turn off WiFi
   - Navigate around - should still work!
6. **Test notification**: (we'll add this later)

### On iOS (Safari):

1. **Visit your site**: https://asavoiu.pythonanywhere.com
2. **Tap Share button**: (square with arrow pointing up)
3. **Tap "Add to Home Screen"**
4. **Tap "Add"**: App icon appears
5. **Tap icon**: Opens full screen!
6. **Test offline**: Works like Android

Note: iOS won't show the install button - users must add manually.

### On Desktop (Chrome/Edge/Brave):

1. **Visit your site**
2. **Look for install icon**: In address bar (right side)
3. **Click install**: App opens in own window
4. **Pin to taskbar**: Feels like desktop app!
5. **Test**: Works exactly like native app

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Open Developer Tools (F12) and check:

### Console Tab
Look for these messages:
- ✅ `Service Worker registered successfully`
- ✅ `Install prompt available` (if not installed yet)

### Application Tab (Chrome DevTools)

**Manifest:**
- Go to Application → Manifest
- Should show "Pushup Counter" with all icons
- No errors

**Service Worker:**
- Go to Application → Service Workers
- Should show "activated and running"
- Try "Update" button - should work

**Storage:**
- Go to Application → Cache Storage
- Should see "pushup-counter-v1"
- Contains your cached files

### Network Tab
- Refresh page
- Look for requests
- Should see some coming from "ServiceWorker" (cached!)

---

## 🎨 Lighthouse Audit (Optional but Cool!)

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Click "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App"
4. Click "Analyze page load"

**Target Score: 90+** ✅

Common issues:
- Missing icons: Generate them!
- No HTTPS: PythonAnywhere provides this ✅
- No service worker: Already implemented ✅

---

## 🔔 Push Notifications (Future Enhancement)

Currently set up but not sending. To add:

### Backend (Django):
```python
# Install: pip install pywebpush

from pywebpush import webpush, WebPushException

def send_notification(subscription_info, message):
    try:
        webpush(
            subscription_info=subscription_info,
            data=json.dumps(message),
            vapid_private_key="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
            vapid_claims={"sub": "mailto:your-email@example.com"}
        )
    except WebPushException as ex:
        print("Error:", ex)
```

### Frontend:
Already set up in service worker!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Service Worker registration failed"
- Check browser console for specific error
- Ensure HTTPS (PythonAnywhere provides this)
- Check service-worker.js path is correct

### "Manifest not loading"
- Check manifest.json path
- Ensure collectstatic was run
- Check browser console for errors

### "Icons not showing"
- Run generate_icons.py
- Check icons exist in static/icons/
- Run collectstatic
- Clear browser cache

### "Install prompt not appearing"
**Android:**
- Must be on HTTPS ✅
- Must have manifest ✅
- Must have service worker ✅
- Must meet installability criteria ✅
- May not show if previously dismissed

**iOS:**
- Never shows automatically
- Users must add manually via Share button

### "Offline mode not working"
- Check service worker is activated
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear cache and reload
- Check Network tab shows "from ServiceWorker"
